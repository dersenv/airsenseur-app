Its aim is to enable the general public (amateurs or professionals) to receive and share information about the quality of ambient air. Specifically, the app’s purposes are:</p><ul><li>to inform users about the quality of ambient air;</li><li>to notify users in case of an exceedance of pre-set pollution tresholds;</li><li>to display data from the air-sensing platform developed by the JRC (AirSenseEUR) or by other sensor networks that publish their data using sensor observation services compliant with the <a ng-click=\"openExternalLink('http://inspire.ec.europa.eu')\">Inspire directive</a>.</li></ul><p>This app is developed as part of the <a ng-click=\"openExternalLink('http://digitalearthlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/mygeoss')\">Mygeoss project</a>, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The project aims to develop smart internet applications to inform and engage European citizens about the changes affecting their environment, and extend the pool of open source software and open data available to the global community through the <a ng-click=\"openExternalLink('http://earthobservations.org/index.php')\">Global Earth Observation System of Systems</a>. </p>"

The framework can support multiple sensors measuring different meteorological parameters, such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity, and pollutants. In its current configuration the platform measures four pollutants:</p><ol><li>Carbon monoxide</li><li>Nitrogen monoxide</li><li>Nitrogen dioxide</li><li>Ozone</li></ol><br/><p>If you select a different network of sensors from AirSenseEUR, then the app will display whatever parameters are collected and published by that network.</p>"
